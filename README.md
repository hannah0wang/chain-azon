## How It Works
- Send a shopping request in plain English:
    - "Order ingredients for spaghetti from Walmart."
    - "Find me the best laptop under $1000 from Amazon."
- Stake & Fund Purchases
    - Stake ETH through P2P.org to earn yield.
    - The AI-agent decides when to stake, restake, or withdraw based on market conditions.
    - When ready to shop, the AI converts yield into purchasing power and funds a virtual credit card.
- Validate & Complete Transactions
    - An Actively Validated Service ensures the AI-agent actually deposits funds before making purchases.
    Transactions are secure, trackable, and reversible if needed.
